I suppose it would make sense to take out the cleanup commands I have in RunDualFormat.vbs and put them in the new UFT script.

Should make a call like 
	strStatus = RunAdvisor("SetupEnv")
before all of the other calls

Structure of SetupEnv:
	1. FilePrepare
		Where I would put the commands I took out of RunDualFormat.vbs
	2. GuardianPrepare
		Kill Guardian
		Reopen
		Look enter username and password, login
		resize window
	3. TIPSPrepare
		TipsKillAll.bat
		Reopen
		Start>Diagnostic
		(wait for login button)
		enter credentiatls and login

Creating
GUI Test in C:\Automation\Duplicate Check, right?
Created the three Call-to-Actions (why are they called that)

Added all commands to action 1, should be done
skipping action 2 for now
In action three I plan on running TipsKillAll.bat
	but it has two pauses that require a key press to continue
	Should I make a new batch file with those taken out or tell UFT to make the key presses?
	Paul recommends I go with path 2
How can I be sure UFT knows when to key press?
	Have timed waits?					NO
	Create a zzflag.exe in the Bin, open it before,
		and wait for it to be closed last?		Maybe?
	Have it press a key every second until the
		cmd window disappears?				Maybe?
	Paul says option 3

I've decided, at Paul's suggestion, to rearrange some of the commands, namely, to move all of the kill sections to the first action to keep them all in one place.
So, I renamed the first action to "EnvironmentClear":
Updated Structure of SetupEnv:
	1. EnvironmentClear
		Where I would put the commands I took out of RunDualFormat.vbs
	2. GuardianPrepare
		Kill Guardian
		Reopen
		Look enter username and password, login
		resize window
	3. TIPSPrepare
		TipsKillAll.bat
		Reopen
		Start>Diagnostic
		(wait for login button)
		enter credentiatls and login
