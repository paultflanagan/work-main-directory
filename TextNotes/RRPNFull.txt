State of my Progress on the Duplicate Check Project:
I've been working on 3 of the tests in the project: Dual Format, In Lot Cancel Decom, and 7.40.011.
Test States (for manual runs):
    Dual Format:            Consistent 100% successful completion runs, ~11 minute run time
    In Lot Cancel Decom:    Consistent 100% successful completion runs, ~15.5 minute run time
    7.40.011:               One final issue remaining regarding OverrideQuarantineLot_81x step, otherwise ~35 minute run time


Run Review:

All tests begin with calls to a selection from a group of preparatory scripts I've put together: ScriptForcequit.bat, SetupEnv.vbs, TIPSDiagnostic_Prepare.vbs, and GrdCfgMgr_StartLogin.vbs.
    ScriptForcequit.bat:    closes out any lingering instances of UFT, Wscript, and QtpAutomationAgent.
    SetupEnv.vbs:           deletes result output files from previous test runs and ensures Guardian and Screen Manager are closed
    TIPSDiagnostic_Prepare: Opens Screen Manager in Diagnostic mode and logs in as superuser.
    GrdCfgMgr_StartLogin:   Opens Guardian and logs in to the server as qa.

Dual Format:
    Procedure:
        Runs all four of the prep scripts 
        Purges Data in the server
        Loads a GoodLot of 100 items, closes out the lot
        Loads a QuarantineLot of 100 items with some duplicate numbers shared with GoodLot.
        Attempts to close the lot and looks for the Quarantine Lot Dialog Window to show that the server has detected the duplicates
        Closes the lot and checks the Duplicate Check inbox for validation of the server-detected duplicates.
        Ends the script
        
Present Issues:
    Automatic Testing issues across automated testing instances:
        When running an automatically initiated test, the script is in some cases unable to run UFT scripts.
            Specific triggers: No remote access window to the working machine, box with remote access to machine is logged out.
        Current attempted fix: I have been informed that an updated version of HP UFT is available, which is supposedly more compatible with remote testing and will potentially resolve the issue.
    OverrideQuarantineLot_81x issue in 7.40.011 test:
        When running the 7.40.011 test, a lot is manually loaded with duplicate product numbers shared with a lot processed earlier in the test.
        When the test is run straight through, the generated results imply that the duplicates are not detected, that is, there are no warning emails automatically sent from the server.
        However, when the script is paused after the numbers have been loaded, even with the same manually loaded data, the warning emails are sent, showing that the duplicates have been detected.
            Specific triggers: When test is interrupted, e.g. with a Message Box, and UFT is closed, reopened and resumed, duplicates are detected. Otherwise, no duplicates detected.
        Current attempted fix: Look for a way to give server more time to process lot without interruption
