Dupes Troubleshooting Post Lot Quarantine Cancel

I have moved over to this test while Paul works on setting up another machine for me to run 8.3.0
Adding the standard setup (ScriptForcequit.bat, SetupEnv.vbs, GrdCfgMgr_StartLogin.vbs, TIPSDiagnostic_Prepare.vbs) to head.
Let's first check the main script, C:\RunPostLotQuarantineDecom.vbs

It is not in C:\. Checking C:\Duplicate Check\
Found a file titled "RunPosLotQuarantineDecom.vbs"
    I'll rename it and move it to C:\ to match the Jenkins call
Crack it open


Steps:
PurgeData

Process "PreLot_SingleItemDecomA.xls" through FT_Provisioning_Driver
Run     "DuplicateCheckOneLevel_Reject"
Process "PostLot_SingleItemDecomA.xls" through FT_Provisioning_Driver

Process "PreLot_SingleItemDecomB.xls" through FT_Provisioning_Driver
Run     "DuplicateCheckOneLevel_Reject2"
Process "PostLot_SingleItemDecomB.xls" through FT_Provisioning_Driver

End of Test

Seems like a pretty straightforward (dare I say, short?) test


Let's examine these files
PreLot_SingleItemDecomA.xls
    Sets both SafeGuards to OFF
    Imports:
        Range:              ImportFiles\Functional\Lot_SingleItemDecom\FT-A_Range_Bottle_0.xml
        FullyRandomList:    "           "           "           "     \FT-A_List_Bottle_0.xml
        PartialRandomList:  "           "           "           "     \Product FT-A_20170000-000_9918801000000000-001_x1x_1.txt
PostLot_SingleItemDecomA.xls
    Sets both SafeGuards to ON
    Disables a number range
PreLot_SingleItemDecomB.xls
    Sets both SafeGuards to OFF
    Imports:
        Range:              ImportFiles\Functional\Lot_SingleItemDecom\FT-A_Range_Bottle_5000.xml
        FullyRandomList:    "           "           "           "     \FT-A_List_Bottle_5000.xml
        PartialRandomList:  "           "           "           "     \Product FT-A_20170000-000_9918801000005000-001_x1x_1.txt
PostLot_SingleItemDecomB.xls
    Sets both SafeGuards to ON
    Disables a number range
    
Checking the ReadMe for the Lot_SingleItemDecom directory:
    "2 duplicates @ position 10 in List file 5000"
All of the various data sets have 5000 items

Time to dig into the UFT scripts
Hang on, I think I've already used _Reject
Yeah definitely
Let's look at _Reject2
    Uses a unique VE_A, _Quarantine_PostLot
        Seems like a version of _Quarantine with a target file of "C:\baseline_postlot.txt"
    I also see one action, "EndLot_QuarantineReject", which I may need to rework later
    
For now, let's give it a shot


Running test 0...
Aw man, I just realized I forgot to set the target file
    has been running well so far, though.
    16 passed results in 11 minutes.
I did some quick file manipulation on the fly and rewrote the contents of baseline_target.txt to match _postlot.txt
    might work
Had an issue navigating to "Manual Notification Resend" and threw an error
Finished, generated an email without an attachment.

is missing "Test_Results\PreprocessGuardianResults_PostLotQuarantineDecom.vbs"
Let's take a look
There was a file called PreprocessGuardianResults_PostLot.vbs
made a copy with the full requested name.
Piping the results along...
Email and attachment received.
Results:
	Run Time:		00:18:56
	Success Totals:	24/25
	Failed Cases:	FT_Notifications    [Lot 2]                         (20)
Not too bad for a first run.
First, let's add in the file targeting commands
_Reject2 > Initialize now sets _target to _postlot.
I did notice where step 20 went wrong, but let's make another run to verify.


Running test 0.1...
Could not purge because of an open lot?
The lines tab says there aren't any lots open.

There was a suspended lot tucked away which had to be resolved.
Trying again


Running test 0.1.1...
if the script was unable to successfully close out a lot before the end of the test, it may be indicative of a larger problem.
"COM surrogate has stopped working"
Once more...


Running test 0.1.2...
Results:
	Run Time:		00:17:57
	Success Totals:	23/25
	Failed Cases:	Email Validation    [Lot 1]                         (8),
                    FT_Notifications    [Lot 2]                         (20)
Rats.
Resuming and closing the remaining lot.
Once again.


Running test 0.2...
Finally got a .pdf first try.
Results:
	Run Time:		00:17:52
	Success Totals:	23/25
	Failed Cases:	Email Validation    [Lot 1]                         (8),
                    FT_Notifications    [Lot 2]                         (20)
Let's run with UFT visible so we can see right where the issues are.
Setting qtApp.Visible = True

Running test 0.3...
forgot to hit save.


Running test 0.3.1...
I think 8 may have been failing because I have not been clearing the email tables after I manually quarantine the suspended lots
    this would leave the quarantine confirmation messages in the table for the VE_A to find when it did not expect any.
after having cleared the email table, step 8 passed.
Some weird stuff going on in EndLot_QuarantineReject of _Reject2
Not suspending the lot, not navigating to the correct window (and not giving any notification when it failed to do either)
Results:
	Run Time:		00:22:17
	Success Totals:	24/25
	Failed Cases:	FT_Notifications    [Lot 2]                         (20)
so the 8 case is understood, at least.

I'll step through _Reject2 > EndLot_QuarantineReject to see what's up
ah, it's using "frmDuplicateAction_original" instead of "frmDuplicateAction"
{"Second User Entry" Dialog object was not found in the Object Repository}
    In Advisor library for the SecondSig function
Need to associate "AdvisorObjects_V2.tsr" for this one to work, if I'm reading the GetGTIN file correctly.
Now it's getting stuck on the "Decom Item" button
Let's see where ILCD has its stored.
These two actions actually seem very similar.
I'll do a side-by-side and see if I can just copy all of _Reject3 over to _Reject2.
Taking from Action13 of both.
Yeah, they seem identical, all the way down to the specific item numbers.
Alright, so that code should be nicer to read now.
Let's get back to figuring out the proper object repo

_Reject3 had it stored locally.
Let's put it into a shared repo
AdvisorObjects_V2 seems to have the most similar items already, so I'll put it there.
Hopping back on _Reject2 to see how much that fixed

That part worked, but I think there's something wrong with the code I took from _Reject3?
It tries to close the lot, quarantines the lot, reworks duplicate numbers, then tries to close the lot again
    I think it should maybe just hit cancel the first time?
Wait, I'm an idiot, it does what I want it to do
    it was the last one which was incorrect, but I copied over it.
Let's try another run


Running test 1...
Got stuck in an endless loop.
Issue: ReadTag("InLot-A") = 1
    "<Type mismatch: 'ReadTag'>"
Oh, there may be an issue with another unassociated library
It's in Advisor_V2 in _Reject3
Associating Advisor_V2 to _Reject2
Cleaned it up, let's try again


Running test 1.1...
.pdf gen failed again, but I piped it through.
Results:
	Run Time:		00:17:45
	Success Totals:	24/24
	Failed Cases:	none
neat
It's down a case, but now it matches ILCD, which I think makes more sense


+++++++++++

+++++++++++
The run I set last night after adding this test to the tail of the procedure completed a full clear
Feel pretty confident in the continued success of this test, so I'll be moving on for now.
