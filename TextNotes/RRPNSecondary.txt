State of my Progress on the Duplicate Check Project:
Test States (for manual runs):
    Dual Format:            Consistent 100% successful completion runs, ~11 minute run time

Run Review:

All tests begin with calls to a selection from a group of preparatory scripts I've put together: ScriptForcequit.bat, SetupEnv.vbs, TIPSDiagnostic_Prepare.vbs, and GrdCfgMgr_StartLogin.vbs.
    ScriptForcequit.bat:    closes out any lingering instances of UFT, Wscript, and QtpAutomationAgent.
    SetupEnv.vbs:           deletes result output files from previous test runs and ensures Guardian and Screen Manager are closed
    TIPSDiagnostic_Prepare: Opens Screen Manager in Diagnostic mode and logs in as superuser.
    GrdCfgMgr_StartLogin:   Opens Guardian and logs in to the server as qa.

Dual Format:
    Procedure:
        Runs all four of the prep scripts 
        Purges Data in the server
        Loads a GoodLot of 100 items, closes out the lot
        Loads a QuarantineLot of 100 items with some duplicate numbers shared with GoodLot.
        Attempts to close the lot and looks for the Quarantine Lot Dialog Window to show that the server has detected the duplicates
        Closes the lot and checks the Duplicate Check inbox for validation of the server-detected duplicates.
        Ends the script
        
Present Issues:
    Automatic Testing issues across automated testing instances:
        When running an automatically initiated test, the script is in some cases unable to run UFT scripts.
            Specific triggers: No remote access window to the working machine, box with remote access to machine is logged out.
        Current attempted fix: I have been informed that an updated version of HP UFT is available, which is supposedly more compatible with remote testing and will potentially resolve the issue.
