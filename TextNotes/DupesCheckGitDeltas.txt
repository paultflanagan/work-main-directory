//Because I did not set up PaulTest3's C:\ as a git repo (and because I don't want to now) I will be keeping track of the changes I make so that I can more easily transfer them to my own machine for pushing to the remote repository
//This is a temporary solution which will not be used for future boxes. It's just here to help me out until then

//Format:
//~~~~~~~~~~~
//[Date of transfer with intended commit message]

//[deltas go here]

//[Date of next transfer with intended commit message]
