Update on project goals:
	Ideal:		something that can automatically run through new and old code and interpret the comment structures and formats we've been writing and using.
	Realistic:	a program that we will have to go through updating old code, and will write new code comments with its functionalities and limitations in mind.
				as long as it works out of the box (i.e. isn't broken code) it is a viable option
					beyond that, it's just whichever is easiest / simplest to implement.

Software to Look into (support VBScript):


					Diagnosis:
Doxygen		(requires plugin)	Difficult to setup
Document! X				Installing
Natural Docs	(partial(?))		
ROBODoc					Difficult to setup
VSdocman				Non-free

Doxygen:

	VBFilter:
		Works by transforming VB into C++ like syntax so it can be read by Doxygen
		Necessary files: sh.exe, gawk.exe, tee.exe, vbfilter.zip (some located on website)
		Once the files are installed, invoke the filter by including the tag:
			INPUT_FILTER = drive:/path/to/unxtools/vbfilter.bat drive:\path\to\unxtools
				ex: C:\Users\user\directory\vbfilter.bat C:\Users\user\directory

			Missing unix commands so far: none
			look for them on google 

			All missing commands have been located and added.

			VBFilter has been successfully(?) setup

	Steps for creating docs:
		doxygen -g <config-file>
		//If filenames include spaces, wrap in double quotes ("C:/Program Files/")
			EXTENSION_MAPPING	=	qfl=C++	//might not be necessary, "Any other extension is parsed as if it is a C/C++ file."
			INPUT			=	[source directory]
			FILE_PATTERNS		=	*.c \
							...
							*.qfl
			INPUT_FILTER		=	drive:/path/to/unxtools/vbfilter.bat drive:\path\to\unxtools
			OUTPUT			=	[output location]

		current issue: does not recognize .qfl as a file extension (even though I thought I was telling it that it was?)
		to try: adding the direct file name (the .qfl) to the INPUT config value

		ok nevermind it works now, somehow

		Taken from doxygen_manual.chm, section "Doxygen usage":
			To generate a manual for your project you typically need to follow these steps:

			You document your source code with special documentation blocks (see section Special comment blocks).
			You generate a configuration file (see section Configuration) by calling doxygen with the -g option:
				doxygen -g <config_file>
			You edit the configuration file so it matches your project. In the configuration file you can specify the input files and a lot of optional information.
			You let doxygen generate the documentation, based on the settings in the configuration file:
				doxygen <config_file>

	Rules for composing comment sections to be parsed by Doxygen:
	(in doxygen_manual.chm, included in file download from website)


	According to the VBFilter readme, I have to edit the code in a VB-Editor, not in a text editor like I've been using.

	I've been looking around for a good vb-editor, but not too much luck so far. 
	I think the issue is the file extension: the VB editors don't recognize *.qfl as a VBScript
	I'm pretty sure that the code is just treated as VBS, but is actually just a subclass of it. I may need a more specialized Editor
		So, basically, the Doxygen makes Docs from C++, the VBFilter makes C++-parsable code from VBScript code, and I need something which interprets a Quicktest Function Library (.qfl) file as VBscript
		It's like I need to speak in German, but all I have are a Spanish-German and English-Spanish dictionaries
	There is an editor I've seen on some boxes called HP Unified Functional Testing, but it isn't on my computer.
		The website for downloading it seems a bit involved, e.g. asking for your company, so I'll ask Paul P.


	I feel I may be reaching the end of my usefulness in this, and that maybe I should switch on to the next program to try out, since what I am doing seems like it would be easier if I had more experience knowledge of VBscript.
	
	Paul P. says to continue working until I hit a wall again, at which point I may need to try one of the other DocGen programs

	The reason we want Doxygen is that it's free and it's trusted



VSdocman
	Seems like it's a paid program. Moving on...

ROBODoc
	Off the bat seems like it will be much easier to implement, like I think I will have more headway with this in a fourth of the time.
		Not that Trying Doxygen wasn't a fun exercise, it's just that it wasn't producing results 
	(n.b. these files aren't readable in vanilla Notepad, use another reader, e.g. Notepad++)
	Important data from README:
		build + install : INSTALL
		usage : Docs/manual.html
		example headers : Headers/
		example source code : Source/
	""	""	INSTALL:
		shell command './configure && make && make install' should auto configure, build, and install
			my error: no C compiler (I'll download one real quick) (Use MinGW)
				already I gotta say this seems like a really well made program (Has extensive error logs!!)
			now I also needed a make command from one of the GCC downloads, through MinGW
			and also Perl I guess, for the automake command.
				this is, if not frustrating, a bit annoying, since I have no idea which components I'm missing before I start a new software like this
				although I suppose it is to be expected: this is a new machine and I haven't taken time to load any important base software

		So currently, I think (maybe) that the issue might be that I'm using the 64bit version of MinGW but the automake installers are calling for a 32bit version
		That is, one of the programs calls to /mingw/bin/autom4te-2.68, but what I have is /mingw64/bin/autom4te-2.68
			again, I'm not sure, but it's my best guess at the moment.
		And I'm sure that just renaming the directory to be mingw without the 64 would be a fun way to fix it, I'll bet that it would bite me later on
		Although, possibly, I just need an updated version of autoconf?
		
		Hitting another wall again, let's see if there's one that doesn't require oodles of setup

Document! X
	Seems like it might require a paid version in order to make full access, but I'll see what I can do w/ trial
	open doc X when I get back to it

Natural Docs
	"Free and Open Source" - already off to a good start
	According to the website, adding another compatible language is as simple as editing a .txt file
	I'll go ahead and download it, see if it's as easy as it claims to be
	


Potential New Lead: Random Online 	
	I googled ""qtp" documentation generator" and found a post by a guy from 2011 who apparently tried to create his own doc-gen for QTP
	I've downloaded the ZIP file. I'll read on and see if I can get this to work
	Considering it was designed specifically for the environment we're using, I am a bit more hopeful for this one
	However, the guy only has one total post on the forum.
		This could either be good, meaning the program works flawlessly and no one has ever needed additional help with it
		(or it's just a garbage program.)
	Looking at it at a glance, it seems like it's a lot of individual .vbs and .qfl files that I would have to pick out and run, as opposed to something usable through command prompt / shell, which could be difficult for me, as someone not too familiar with UFT and QTP
