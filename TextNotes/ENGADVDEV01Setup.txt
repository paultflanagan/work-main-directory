Common scripts and what I have changed prior to the copy transfer
C:\results.vbs
	Changes:
		Minor -	commented out the call and closing of an otherwise unused WScript.shell
C:\results.bat
	Changes:
		Major -	changed move target location from C:\Automation\Duplicate Check\ReportFramework\Test_Results\ to C:\Automation\ReportFramework\Test_Results\
C:\Automation\ReportFramework\Test_Driver\RenameLatestTXTtoduplicatecheck.vbs
	Changes:
		Major -	swapped finicky "WscriptObj.currentdirectory" declaration of DriverScriptFrameWorkFolderPath for a hard coded one (to "C:\Automation\ReportFramework\Test_Driver")

Important Locations to copy:
Probably all of C:\Automation\
Probably none of C:\jenkins\ or C:\PimLabTestData
C:\results.vbs
C:\results.bat
C:\RunDualFormat.vbs	//I know it won't need it for it's purposes, but it couldn't hurt (too much)
C:\sg3.bat
C:\sg2.bat

All of C:\Automation is taking too long.
It's probably C:\Automation\Duplicate Check\'s many script directories which are slowing the process down
	Yeah it's over 10x larger than the other two subdirectories combined
Let's find the scripts I worked with and leave the other ones behind.
\DuplicateCheckOneLevel_*\	(6 folders)
\FT_DualFormat_Driver\
\GrdCfgMgr_StartLogin\
\PurgeData\
\SetupEnv\
\VerifyEmail_App_*\			(5 folders)

\838\
\Advisor UFT\ 
\Emails\
\ImportFiles\

Going to go to lunch soon, I'll copy everything that isn't in C:\Automation\Duplicate Check\ first

So after cutting \Duplicate Check\ down, it says it will take 1 hour 40 minutes, which is a lot, but it's less than the 8 hour estimate, so I guess I'll just find something else to do
oh cool it went from like 1h15m to 24m.
Jumped up and is hovering around 1GB/s. Says 6.5m
Ended up only taking like 10-15m

Changes needed from PaulTest3 version to ENGADVDEV01 version:
C:\Automation\ReportFramework\Test_Results\Final_results.bat
	Major -	change "Y:\jenkins\workspace\Automation\UniSeries\System Level Test Container\System Level Report\Project_Report_duplicatecheck.txt"
			to "Y:\jenkins\workspace\Automation\UniSeries\8.4.0\SVT\Duplicate Check Report\Project_Report_duplicatecheck.txt"

After setting up the files in the system, I took out the prep scripts and put them on Jenkins, like I said I would
but not as their own jobs, just as additional commands at the beginning of the current job I'm running
	I think it will do the trick for now, I can ask Paul if he thinks it works as a long term solution later.

Seems to have initiated properly
	According to the Dupes Setup Word Doc, this particular test takes about 25 minutes to run


No .pdf was attached to the result email.
I realize that I didn't copy the updated version of the .pdf generation script from the old jenkins subdirectory into the new one
	Could that have been it?
I will compare the scripts to see if the old one could be broken
Seems different enough to warrant a fix.
Copying over updated .vbs script and updating file path variables


Forgot to copy over TipsKillAllAuto.cmd (and ScriptForceQuit.bat)


I think it is the "qtTest.Run Void True" which allows it to work properly, the true probably signifies that it must wait for the script to complete before continuing
	NO idea why that isn't a default option feature for any script running command...
	As a side note, I think that the "void" is where the test name would go
		but, since the previous command is "qtTest.Open [test_name]", "void" probably tells it to run the open test

Failed to purge, and did not interact with TIPS at all or get past check 7.
Turned out the VisionSimulator.exe had been removed when we updated the software on the box
	Added it back in and it is running fine

... did we install python on this box?
I think we did
But, I know we did not modify the access privileges for outlook (the dialog box popped up and I had to give it permission)

Froze up, so I killed it, removed the warning setting for outlook, and ran again
	(this is starting to sound like a DupesTestingLog entry, but I'm in denial: I really don't want this to take long enough to warrant moving over to that file).
	
Same issue. Getting Paul's help

Possible lead on a feature I was unaware of:
	On the server-side .sql manager (which I'd never really interacted with before), for each lot you process, you need to mark certain data types for dupes checking 
		why that isn't the default, I have no idea
			Paul says it might be because he updated the server software, which may have reset the configuration
Anyway, this may explain why we've not been getting dupes confirmation, and may have to do with why I was getting a similar error on the PaulTest3 box.
	Although it might not, since I was working with that before the software update.

Feels good to be making relatively steady progress, though.
