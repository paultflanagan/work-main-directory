Update on project goals:
	Ideal:		something that can automatically run through new and old code and interpret the comment structures and formats we've been writing and using.
	Realistic:	a program that we will have to go through updating old code, and will write new code comments with its functionalities and limitations in mind.
				as long as it works out of the box (i.e. isn't broken code) it is a viable option
					beyond that, it's just whichever is easiest / simplest to implement.

Prerequisite steps for NaturalDocs implementation: 
	Have a working shell program
	Take "Natural Docs" and place into C:\Program Files (x86)
	Add C:\Program Files (x86)\Natural Docs" to Path variables under System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables.
	Should be able follow \Natural Docs\Help.html file from there
