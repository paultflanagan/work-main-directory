This folder contains a UFT project used as a driver for Functional Testing.
Some of the Actions are shared Actions that are re-used.
The shared Actions are data-driven by XLS datasheets.
The goal of each shared Action is to import SPT numbers and check for an expected result.

This driver import the same SPT number list as two different formats by changing the object key/value pair prior to import.
